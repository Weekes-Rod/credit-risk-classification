# Credit Risk Analysis Report

## Overview
This analysis aims to predict the credit risk of loans using a logistic regression model based on various loan attributes.

## Results
- **Accuracy**: 0.99
- **Precision**: 0.85
- **Recall**: 0.91

## Summary
The logistic regression model performs well in predicting credit risk. It achieves an accuracy of 0.99, indicating strong overall performance. The precision score of 0.85 for high-risk loans (label 1) suggests that among the loans predicted as high-risk, 85% are actually high-risk. The recall score of 0.91 indicates that the model correctly identifies 91% of the actual high-risk loans. Overall, these metrics demonstrate the model's effectiveness in identifying both healthy and high-risk loans. Based on these results, I recommend using this model for credit risk classification.
